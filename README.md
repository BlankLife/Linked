# CS472 Senior Project: "Linked"

Linked is a Dynamic Social Platform that will let the business owner put up their business onto the application. The application will let the owner put activities that they offer onto their business. The user will be able to go to these businesses and check-in at them to do a certain activity. For example, if I would want to lift weights at a gym and would like a partner, I would just check-in and do the activity until someone would want to do the activity with me.
